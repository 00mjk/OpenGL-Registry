    OpenGL Extension #525

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 4.6 Specification
    (Compatibility Profile), dated October 24, 2016.

    OpenGL 4.5 is required.

    This extension requires support for the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
    extension "NV_compute_shader_derivatives", which can be found at the
    Khronos Group Github site here:

Overview

    This extension adds OpenGL API support for the OpenGL Shading Language
    (GLSL) extension "NV_compute_shader_derivatives".

    That extension, when enabled, allows applications to use derivatives in
    compute shaders.  It adds compute shader support for explicit derivative
    built-in functions like dFdx(), automatic derivative computation in
    texture lookup functions like texture(), use of the optional LOD bias
    parameter to adjust the computed level of detail values in texture lookup
    functions, and the texture level of detail query function
    textureQueryLod().
